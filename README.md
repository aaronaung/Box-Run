<h1>BoxRun - README</h1><br>
<h2>Game Description</h2><br>
<p>Box Run is a competitive multiplayer platformer that has the players racing against each other to reach the end first; the one who reaches the end first is the winner, but that is no simple task. There are many obstacles to overcome and it is up to the player to decide their route. Traverse from the underground to the goal line: from platform to platform, wall to wall, gravity to zero-gravity, all while avoiding the other player’s cannons.</p>

<h3>Feelings The Game Should Elicit in Players</h3><br>
<p>We want the players of Box Run to feel a competitive rush when they play against each other. We want them to get excited when the unexpected or unfortunate happens (i.e. when they go through a zero gravity gate for the first time or get stunned by another player’s cannon and fall to their death). We want them to have fun competing with one another and with trying to find their own “fastest” way through the level.</p>
